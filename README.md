_stm32f4xx-hal_ contains a multi device hardware abstraction on top of the
peripheral access API for the STMicro STM32F2/F4/F7 series microcontrollers. The
selection of the MCU is done by feature gates, typically specified by board
support crates. Currently supported configurations are:

The idea behind this crate is to gloss over the slight differences in the
various peripherals available on those MCUs so a HAL can be written for all
chips in that same family without having to cut and paste crates for every
single model.

### Other optional features

* `rtic1` — support [RTICv1 framework](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtic).
* `rtic2` — support [RTICv2 framework](https://crates.io/crates/rtic) (incompatible with `rtic1`, require nightly compiller).
* `defmt` — implementation of `defmt::Format` for public enums and structures. See [defmt](https://crates.io/crates/defmt).
* `can` — bxCAN peripheral support. See [bxcan](https://crates.io/crates/bxcan).
* `i2s` — I2S peripheral support. See [stm32_i2s_v12x](https://crates.io/crates/stm32_i2s_v12x).
* `usb_fs` or `usb_hs` — USB OTG FS/HS peripheral support. See [synopsys-usb-otg](https://crates.io/crates/synopsys-usb-otg).
* `fsmc_lcd` — LCD support via FMC/FSMC peripheral. See [display-interface](https://crates.io/crates/display-interface).
* `sdio-host` — SDIO peripheral support. See [sdio-host](https://crates.io/crates/sdio-host).

Collaboration on this crate is highly welcome as are pull requests!

This crate relies on Adam Greigs fantastic [stm32f4][] crate to provide
appropriate register definitions and implements a partial set of the
[embedded-hal][] traits.

Some of the implementation was shamelessly adapted from the [stm32f1xx-hal][]
crate originally started by Jorge Aparicio.

## Setting up your project

Check if the BSP for your board exists in the
[stm32-rs](https://github.com/stm32-rs) page.
If it exists, the `stm32f4xx-hal` crate should be already included, so you can
use the bsp as BSP for your project.

### Manually

Otherwise, create a new Rust project as you usually do with `cargo init`. The
"hello world" of embedded development is usually to blink a LED. The code to do
so is available in [examples/delay-syst-blinky.rs](examples/delay-syst-blinky.rs).
Copy that file to the `main.rs` of your project.

You also need to add some dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
embedded-hal = "0.2"
nb = "1"
cortex-m = "0.7"
cortex-m-rt = "0.7"
# Panic behaviour, see https://crates.io/keywords/panic-impl for alternatives
panic-halt = "0.2"

[dependencies.stm32f4xx-hal]
version = "0.21.0"
features = ["stm32f407"] # replace the model of your microcontroller here
                         # and add other required features
```

We also need to tell Rust how to link our executable and how to lay out the
result in memory. To accomplish all this, copy [.cargo/config](.cargo/config.toml)
and [memory.x](memory.x) from the `stm32f4xx-hal` repository to your project and make sure the sizes match up with the datasheet. Also note that there might be different kinds of memory which are not equal; to be on the safe side only specify the size of the first block at the specified address.

### Fast start

To create empty project faster you could use `cargo generate` command. See [stm32-template](https://github.com/burrbull/stm32-template/).
```
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/burrbull/stm32-template/
```
Note that you need to know your chip full name.
