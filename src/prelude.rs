//! Convenience re-export of multiple traits.
//!
//! This allows a HAL user to conveniently import this module and have all the
//! helper traits already imported.
//! Otherwise the use of peripherals would require the import of the
//! corresponding module and the import of the trait, which connects this HAL
//! to the autogenerated svd2rust API in [crate::pac].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Consider the following code.
//!
//! ```
//! #[entry]
//! fn main() -> ! {
//!     let dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!     let gpiog = dp.GPIOG.split();
//!     let mut led1 = gpiog.pg13.into_push_pull_output();
//!     led1.set_high().unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Without the prelude we would have to import the following traits:
//!
//! ```
//! use stm32f4xx_hal::gpio::GpioExt; // for the split method.
//! use embedded_hal::digital::v2::OutputPin; // for the set_high() function.
//! // And more use-statements with more complex code.
//! ```
//!
//! These imports are a bit unintuitive, because we can create the objects
//! without the import. But we need these traits to access most of their
//! functions.
//!
//! The prelude module keeps the import section cleaner:
//! ```
//! use stm32f4xx_hal::prelude::*;
//! ```
