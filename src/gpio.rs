//! General Purpose Input / Output
//!
//! The GPIO pins are organised into groups of 16 pins which can be accessed through the
//! `gpioa`, `gpiob`... modules. To get access to the pins, you first need to convert them into a
//! HAL designed struct from the `pac` struct using the [split](trait.GpioExt.html#tymethod.split) function.
//! ```rust
//! // Acquire the GPIOC peripheral
//! // NOTE: `dp` is the device peripherals from the `PAC` crate
//! let mut gpioa = dp.GPIOA.split();
//! ```
//!
//! This gives you a struct containing all the pins `px0..px15`.
//! By default pins are in floating input mode. You can change their modes.
//! For example, to set `pa5` high, you would call
//!
//! ```rust
//! let output = gpioa.pa5.into_push_pull_output();
//! output.set_high();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Modes
//!
//! Each GPIO pin can be set to various modes:
//!
//! - **Alternate**: Pin mode required when the pin is driven by other peripherals
//! - **Analog**: Analog input to be used with ADC.
//! - **Dynamic**: Pin mode is selected at runtime. See changing configurations for more details
//! - Input
//!     - **PullUp**: Input connected to high with a weak pull up resistor. Will be high when nothing
//!     is connected
//!     - **PullDown**: Input connected to high with a weak pull up resistor. Will be low when nothing
//!     is connected
//!     - **Floating**: Input not pulled to high or low. Will be undefined when nothing is connected
//! - Output
//!     - **PushPull**: Output which either drives the pin high or low
//!     - **OpenDrain**: Output which leaves the gate floating, or pulls it do ground in drain
//!     mode. Can be used as an input in the `open` configuration
//!
//! ## Changing modes
//! The simplest way to change the pin mode is to use the `into_<mode>` functions. These return a
//! new struct with the correct mode that you can use the input or output functions on.
//!
//! If you need a more temporary mode change, and can not use the `into_<mode>` functions for
//! ownership reasons, you can use the closure based `with_<mode>` functions to temporarily change the pin type, do
//! some output or input, and then have it change back once done.
//!
//! ### Dynamic Mode Change
//! The above mode change methods guarantee that you can only call input functions when the pin is
//! in input mode, and output when in output modes, but can lead to some issues. Therefore, there
//! is also a mode where the state is kept track of at runtime, allowing you to change the mode
//! often, and without problems with ownership, or references, at the cost of some performance and
//! the risk of runtime errors.
//!
//! To make a pin dynamic, use the `into_dynamic` function, and then use the `make_<mode>` functions to
//! change the mode
