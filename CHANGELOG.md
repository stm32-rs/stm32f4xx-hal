- Support for serial port Idle interrupt.

- Basic `memory.x` linker script and default linking options.

### Changed

- Changed repository URL.

### Fixed

- I2C clock setting.

- GPIO `set_open_drain` is now setting the `otyper` register correctly.

## [v0.2.5] - 2018-11-17

### Added

- Support for stm32f411.

- Spi trait implementation.

### Changed

- Updated stm32f4 dependency to v0.4.0.

- Gpio InputPin implementation for output pins to allow reading current
  value of open drain output pins.

- Timer trait implementation.

### Changed

- No default features selected for the stm32f4 crate. User must specify its
  specific device.
